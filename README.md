- Writes the modified content to a user-specified output file.
- Handles errors gracefully, providing feedback if the file cannot be found or read.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of file handling in Python.

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
